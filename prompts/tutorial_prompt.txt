Please review all of the code in this repository. Please build me a detailed scope document to provide to an LLM for how to build the following user journey within my application. I want to build a tutorial using today's board. I want the user to be able to access this tutorial through an info button that will appear in between the settings button and the stats button. When the user clicks this button a popup should appear that asks them if they would like to see the Color Lock Tutorial. If they click no, the modal should go away and nothing should happen. If the user clicks yes, the current board should fade out and a hardcoded board should fade in. Please use today's board as the hard coded board. The game header should now say "Tutorial" in red instead of "Color Lock". A modal should then appear that says. The goal of Color Lock is to turn all of the colors on the board into the target color in as few moves as possible. The user should then be prompted to continue. An arrow should appear next to the moves with a small tool tip or modal that says this number shows you how many moves you've completed in your current game. The user should be prompted to continue again. Next an arrow should appear suggesting the user click the action the algorithm would take for the first move on this board. Please also hardcode this for todays board. That information can be gathered along with the initial state from the firestore database just like in the game. If the user clicks a tile not in the connected element nothing should happen and a modal should appear telling them to click the suggested tile. When the user clicks the suggested tile another tool tip or modal or note should appear to tell the user that "by clicking a group of connected tiles you get to change it's color. Please change this group of tiles to the color yellow". At the same time as this modal or note appears an arrow should appear to show the user where to click on the color picker modal to change it to yellow. After they click the yellow on the color picker modal please provide an arrow pointing to the blue square in the color picker modal that shows it with a check mark and include a note that says, you can see the color of the square you chose with this check mark. If the user tries to change it to a color that isn't yellow, a modal should appear reiterating that they must change it to yellow. Next an arrow should point to the large block of locked yellow tiles. A modal or note should appear that says. The catch with color lock is that the largest group of same-colored tiles is locked and unchangeable until another group of tiles has surpassed its size. After the user clicks continue to that message, Another modal appears that says "now, we are going to show you the moves the algorithm used to solve this puzzle". Next the code should follow the algorithms solution to this problem using the hardcoded actions for the puzzle. For each move a modal should appear that say changing {oldColor} to {newColor}. That modal should appear near the color being changed. While that modal is present the square should be flashing like the hint functionality flashes. This should continue until move 6. On move 6 a modal should appear that says "in this move we are going to change orange to green. With this move, green will have more total squares than yellow and will lock, causing the yellow blocks to unlock." Next a modal should appear that says "I hope you can see that we are well on our way to winning this game! But first I want to go back a move and show you what would happen if you turned that last orange to yellow". Next we should revert to the prior state and instead of turning orange green, we should turn it yellow, which will prompt the LostGameModal. This lost game modal should have a continue button instead of a try again. When the user continues they should get another message in the modal that says,"Because welocked greater than 13 squares of a non target color, we lost the game. This is because there are 25 squares on the board and if 13 are in a non target color, we can never unlock this group of cells to change it to the target. Now we're going to flip those cells back to green and show you how to finish the game. Next it should show the user the final two moves to complete the game in the same way as it was automatically showing the moves before. This should prompt the winModal. Next to the win modal we should have another note with an arrow that points to the first line that says "Congrats, this shows that you won today's Color Lock in 8 moves". Then it should have an arrow that points to the bot moves with a note that says, you tied the amount of moves made by our bot! This is how we determine the daily goal. Sometimes the bot gets the lowest score possible, but sometimes it doesn't. Lastly an arrow should appear to the try again button that says "Using this button you can try again to see if you could tie the bot on today's board yourself! You'll also notice this try again button below the board when you're playing. You can click this at any time to start a new game on today's board. Please click it now to take you back to today's board". Then this should take the user back to the state that shows today's board. Please review all of the code in this codebase
